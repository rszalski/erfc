eRFC
====

eRFC downloads and formats plain-text RFCs to fit eReaders nicely.

Why?
---------------

RFCs are published as constant width plain text files, formatted with non-printable characters. E-Readers like Kindle can do very well with them but such formatting prevents the text from spanning the whole screen. Reading is tiresome and not as efficent as it could be.
