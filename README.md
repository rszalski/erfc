eRFC
====

eRFC downloads and formats RFC for easy reading on a eBook reader.

Why to do this?
---------------

RFCs are publicated as a constant width plain text files formatted by non-printable characters. Readers like Kindle can do very well with them but such a formatting makes text not fitting the whole screen. Reading is tiresome and not that efficent as it could be.
